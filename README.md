Our unified computational technique to compute various spectrum-based topological descriptors

Let G be a graph for which you would like to compute a sepctrum-based topological descriptors.

Step 1. Draw G on newGraph and check adjacency matrix as an invariant by going to "Invariants" tab to "Select Invariant".

Copy the adjacency matrix by right clicking on the matrix.

Step 2. Paste the matrix and order of G in the Spectral_Based_Descriptors.m file in B and n resepctively.

Run the Spectral_Based_Descriptors.m file to obtain your result.
